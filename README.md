Data Science - Project 2 

Working with a database containing information about soccer teams and the matches they've played (database.sqlite).


How did my work look like:

-> I examineted the data dictionary for the SQL database. I familiarized myself with the tables it contains, and what each column means. 

-> I used this database to get data on each soccer team and calculate some summary statistics.

-> I isolated:
    + The name of the team
    + The total number of goals scored by the team during the 2011 season
    + The total number of wins the team earned during the 2011 season
    
    - A histogram visualization of the team's wins and losses for the 2011 season (store the visualization directly)
    - The team's win percentage on days where it was raining during games in the 2011 season.
    
-> I started coding thinking about how to put some parts into functions and classes, but I didn't have enough time to do it.
